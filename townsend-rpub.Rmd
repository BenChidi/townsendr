Townsend Material Deprivation Score
========================================================

The Townsend Material Deprivation score was devised by Townsend et al in 1988. It uses the following four Census variables:

1. Percent of households without access to a car (car).
2. Percent of households with more than one person per room (overcrowd).
3. Percent of households not owner occupied (tenure).
4. Percent of individuals unemployed who are economically active (unemp).

Each individual domain is converted to a <em>z</em>-score, and the four <em>z</em>-scores are summed to provide the overall Townsend Material Deprivation Score.

The overall score can be calculated for any geographical area for which Census data is available, for example LSOA, MSOA, Ward, or LAD. Because of the nature of <em>z</em>-scores, the scores for each area can be compared. For this reason it is typical to calculate scores nationally. This script calculates Townsend scores for all areas in England and Wales (since Scotland and Northern Ireland data is not yet available).
